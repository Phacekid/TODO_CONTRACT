# todo Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It has a todo list contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
The contract was also deployed on [Sepolia Testnet](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xc35de858FF871dbc216e4345373B82975dEB0928#writeContract)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
